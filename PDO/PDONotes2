# PDO Course part 2

So for this part of the course I am solely focusing on 
the PDO objectand writing down what it does and 
how i need to use it.

In the live coding exercise we used SQLite and we didn't need to 
create variables for the host and etc like we aare seeing now so we will
go and learn about pdo and sqlite at a letter time 
for now lets focus on learning PDO

## PDO
First we are going to want to create a 
PDO instance here we call the 'new PDO()' function
to create a new instance of PDO.

* This is needed to create the connection to the database 

## Making Queries

As far as making queries there are 2 ways to handle this 
    1. *Query method
        This method is fine if we are not using any kind of 
        variables or any kind of user input 

    2. *Prepared statement
        this is for if we are using user input from forms and 
        we need to insert that input 

## PDOquery

so we are going to make a variable stmt
for statement and take the pdo instance and call the Query
method 

inside of this method we are going to write a simple Query
the stmt variable is now storing those result 

now we are going to want to loop through the results and then print them to the screen
we are going to use a while loop for this 

so in the condition statement we are going to
create another variable called rows and then 
store the result of (stmt->fetch()) 

## fetch
with this fetch method we basically tell object how
we want it formatted 
we have some options to choose from 
    - associative array (this is what we are going to do)
    - object (FETCH_OBJ)
    - regular array 
    - key value pairs 

associative arrays and objects are the most common 

## setAttribute 
now if we dont always want to specify which 
format we want to use we can always take this approach 

so lets say we wanted to set the default format to object
well right after we create the PDO instance we can
