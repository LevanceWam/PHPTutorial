Please also look at the tutorial that is offered on w3schools for deeper understanding 

PHP is a programming language
used to make scalable and easily maintainable website or application
this can be accomplished with PHP

PHP intergrates really well with HTML we can write 
the HTML code with PHP right beside it and they work together perfectly

PHP is considered a server-side language it talks to the client
and it sits on the web server 

Starting Up PHP
first thing we need to do when we want to start working 
with php is that we need to create something called a PHP server
when we want to run PHP we have to run it on a web server

this is because php is a server side language that sits on the server 
we can use php on the web server to interact with the website
php will handle giving files to users, getting information from users
moral of the story php runs on the server

in terminal we are going to want to want to start a webserver using php 
the command for this is 

```
php -S localhost:4000
```

this is going to create a webserver for us
next we are going to have to make a folder where we want to store all PHP files
then we are going to make a file with a hello world 

(Refer to HelloWorld)

next to see the code we have written we need to go to
the address bar and place the local host we defined in the terminal 
next in the address bar we are going to want to write out the path to the file we want to 
access 

so for the beginning example we need to type:
localhost:4000/HelloWorld/site.php while the php server is running

Writing HTML
for this part of the tutorial we are going to use the echo command in php 
to write html inside of the php code
so back in HelloWorld/site.php

IMPORTANT:
In php so far we do not have the concept of methods
we have functions instead so instead of calling:
string.toUpper()
we call the function first then we pass the string 
strtoupper($string) 

functions in PHP are specific operations that we can call 

to make a array we do this:
array(element1, element2);
we call an arraylike a function

can not Print an whole array like 
echo $arrayName we have to do some stuff to it 

IMPORTANT CREATING FUNCTIONS:

When we create a function inside of PHP it is similar to how we call a function in 
javascript, But there is a difference when we go to set the parameters

we have to prefix the function parameters with a $ inorder for the application not to yell at us 

IMPORTANT CLASSES AND OBJECTS:
class follow the same syntax as classes for javascript,typescript with a few expection
to declare a property we use var this by default is public 
we can also use private and protected prefixes to define a property in a class

to store a value inside of the property we follow this syntax:
 $book = new Book;
    $book->title = "raisin in the sun";
    $book->author = 'Not sure';
    $book->pages = '402';

We do not use dot notation in php so we have to be careful with everything that we do
Also when we want to use the keyword this we have to prefix it with $
Example
 // notice that the field suffixing the this keyword does not need $
            // this is because this is going to make it a seperate variable and we do not want that
            $this->name = $name;
            $this->major = $major;
            $this->gpa = $gpa;
        }


IMPORTANT DATA TYPES:
String
Integer
Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
Boolean
Array
Object
NULL
Resource

Booleans can not be returned and render in the html like we do for JS 
Example:
return ($this->gpa > 3) ? "true" : "false";

notice that we are returning a string and not the Booleans
for some reason PHP doesn't render the booleans 
we can still return them in the code for other functions or expression 
but not for rendering
